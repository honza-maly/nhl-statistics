This repository contains matlab code used in my paper "Estimating probability".

It contains the following files:
1) varianceOfShootingPercentages.m - used for analysis of standard deviation of a priori distribution of shooting percentages across the league
2) predictingShootingPercentages.m - used for predicting shooting percentages in the second half of the season form first 2,000 shots
3) predictingGoals.m - used for predicting goals per game in the last 41 games from first 41 games
4) artificialTestBeta.m - test of probability estimate which uses artificial data
